Rufus implements a two-tier web scraping system that intelligently extracts structured data from websites based on user instructions. The primary approach uses URL based scraping, analyzing webpage content and extracting structured JSON data. When this first tier yields insufficient results as deemed by a character threshold, Rufus automatically falls back to a search-based approach using SearchGraph, which performs web searches related to the target domain and constructs a graph of nodes for comprehensive data extraction. This dual approach ensures robust data collection even from complex websites with dynamically loaded content.

The development process faced challenges, particularly with JavaScript-heavy websites where content was dynamically rendered and difficult to access through conventional scraping methods, while having a dearth of information available across web sources. These obstacles were overcome by implementing the two-tier approach (involving crawling the entire stem domain and synthesizing information) and incorporating intelligent fallback mechanisms. Future improvements could incorporate browser automation with computer vision/OCR capabilities to address remaining edge cases.
